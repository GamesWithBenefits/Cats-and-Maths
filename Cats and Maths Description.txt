Cats are curious but bad with Math, help them calculate & improve yours too!


Some cats and not cats try to overcome invading giant fleas using their cute voice and fluffy furs but they need your help. Gather your wits to defend your ground.
These giant alien fleas have one big chink in their armour, to defeat them you just have to solve the math problem written on their back.
